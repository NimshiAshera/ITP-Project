			<h2>About Sri Lanka..</h2>

					<div class="Box-Details">
						<h3>Sri Lanka, formerly called "Ceylon", is an island nation in the 
						Indian Ocean, southeast of the Indian subcontinent, in a strategic 
						location near major Indian Ocean sea lanes.Proximity to the Indian 
						subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between 
						Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime 
						routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed 
						to cultural influences from other Asian civilizations. The climate 
						is tropical and warm, due to the moderating effects of ocean winds. 
						Mean temperatures range from 17 °C (62.6 °F) in the central highlands, 
						where frost may occur for several days in the winter. Rainfall pattern 
						is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. </h3>
